## Day 1
What I studied: Codecademy Strings/Hello World/Syntax
What I built: A simple input variant greeting
What confused me: Nothing

## Day 2
What I studied: Codecademy Variables 
What I built: A temperature converter where responses are dependant on a users input and converts the input number from the users preferred temperature method to another (Celsius <> Fahrenheit)
What confused me: Saving a variable inside the string and joining the numbers to the text to form the output. Also struggled with assigning a float status to the numbers input by the user so that the program can interpret that as a number rather than text and carry out the calculations.
