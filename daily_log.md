## Day 1

What I studied: Codecademy Strings/Hello World/Syntax.

What I built: A simple input variant greeting.

What confused me: Nothing.

## Day 2

What I studied: Codecademy Variables 

What I built: A temperature converter where responses are dependant on a users input and converts the input number from the users preferred temperature method to another (Celsius <> Fahrenheit)

What confused me: Saving a variable inside the string and joining the numbers to the text to form the output. Also struggled with assigning a float status to the numbers input by the user so that the program can interpret that as a number rather than text and carry out the calculations.

## Day 3

What I studied: Codecademy Numbers.

What I built: A salary calculator to take a weekly pay and turn it into an annual salary.

What confused me: Once again, the formatting to allow the calculation to happen with the data entered by the user needing to be converted to a float.
